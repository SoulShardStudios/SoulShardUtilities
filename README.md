WARNING: This is still a PREVIEW PACKAGE, use caution when using this in your projects until this repo goes to 1.0.0, at least.
Breaking changes WILL BE MADE up to 1.0.0, so any dependant code will probably break if it is not actively maintained.

Pull requests, Feature requests, Issues, e.t.c. are welcome, since this is mostly a one man project
I would recommend contributing rather than demanding.
